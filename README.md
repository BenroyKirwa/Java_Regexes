# Java_Regexes
## Created a program that validates user input using regexes for the following properties: 
```
1. Name – Letters and Spaces only 
2. Email Address 
3. Mobile Number – Must either start with 254,07,01 or +254, and with the appropriate length
``` 
## Created a program that reads one of your Java files, and prints out all the methods and properties which have private access, using regexes. 
## Created a program that reads the file provided ‘workflow-approval.html’, and prints out all the variables that are in []. E.g. This is a [SAMPLE] text that is a [STRING]. The program needs to print out [SAMPLE] and [STRING]. The brackets are inclusive in the output.
